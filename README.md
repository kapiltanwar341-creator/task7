## Objective

Use JavaScript `fetch` API to get user data from a public API and display it in a webpage.

## Tools

* Chrome (or any modern browser)

## Deliverable

A small webpage that fetches user info from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` and displays each user's name, email, and address. The page should handle errors and provide a reload button to refetch.
